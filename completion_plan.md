# Completion Plan

## Purpose
This plan outlines actionable next steps for developing and improving PersonaBench, ensuring alignment with the repository's purpose and current implementation.

## Immediate Priorities

### 1. Integrate LangChain for Backend Operations
- **Objective**: Use LangChain to manage backend operations, including tool management and scenario handling.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add LangChain as a dependency in the project.
  - Integrate LangChain into the `bench` module for tool management and scenario handling.
  - Ensure compatibility with existing APIs and utilities.

### 2. Implement Tool Budget Management
- **Objective**: Create a `ToolBudget` module to track and enforce tool usage limits.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define the `ToolBudget` class in `agents/tool_budget.py`.
  - Implement methods for budget tracking, validation, and enforcement.
  - Write unit tests to ensure functionality.

### 3. Enhance Logging and Observability
- **Objective**: Improve `TraceLogger` to capture complete plan→act→react cycles.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add structured logging for tool usage and persona signature validation.
  - Ensure logs are JSONL-formatted and include all relevant metadata.
  - Write tests to validate logging behavior.

### 4. Harden Adapters
- **Objective**: Improve robustness of OpenAI, Ollama, and vLLM adapters.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add retry and rate-limiting mechanisms.
  - Write integration tests for adapter behavior under failure scenarios.

### 5. Expand Test Coverage
- **Objective**: Ensure all core components are thoroughly tested.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add smoke tests for new personas and scenarios.
  - Validate persona JSON schemas against `schema.json`.
  - Test plan→act→react behavior for edge cases.

## Current State of the App
- 📝 Schema validation: Working
- 🧪 Test framework: Working
- 💾 Memory system: Not implemented (scenarios inherently need a form of memory).
- 🔧 Tool management: Partially implemented
- 📊 Metrics: Basic implementation

## Long-Term Goals

### 1. Scenario Builder
- **Objective**: Develop a UI or CLI tool for creating and managing scenarios.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define scenario templates for common use cases.
  - Implement validation for scenario configuration files.

### 2. Results Analytics Dashboard
- **Objective**: Build a dashboard for visualizing evaluation results.
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate with existing logging and metrics.
  - Provide comparative analysis tools for personas.

## Development Workflow
1. **Branching**: Create feature branches for each task.
2. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for all new code.
3. **Code Review**: Ensure all changes are reviewed and approved.
4. **Documentation**: Update `README.md` and other relevant documentation.

## Success Metrics
- All tests pass with 100% coverage for new code.
- Tool usage limits are enforced without errors.
- Logs capture complete and accurate data.
- Adapters handle failure scenarios gracefully.
