# PersonaBench PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: A comprehensive benchmarking platform for evaluating AI personas stored as markdown files across diverse scenarios using both algorithmic and human evaluation methods
- **Success Indicators**: Personas demonstrate measurable behavioral differences, evaluation results provide actionable insights, and human evaluators can meaningfully distinguish between persona performances
- **Experience Qualities**: Scientific, transparent, flexible

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality with dual evaluation systems and markdown-based persona management)
- **Primary User Activity**: Creating markdown personas, designing custom scenarios, running evaluations, analyzing comparative results

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Need to systematically evaluate AI personas as they would be used in real applications (as markdown character files), with both objective metrics and human judgment
- **User Context**: AI researchers and developers need to test persona effectiveness across varied tasks with both automated and human validation
- **Critical Path**: Import/create persona markdown → Design/select scenarios → Run evaluations (algorithmic or human) → Compare results across personas and tasks
- **Key Moments**: Persona markdown editing, scenario customization, evaluation type selection, comparative analysis

## Essential Features
- **Markdown Persona Management**: Create, edit, and manage personas as markdown files that can be converted to JSON for various tools and MCPs
- **Custom Scenario Builder**: Create, modify, and categorize test scenarios with transparent evaluation criteria
- **Dual Evaluation System**: Both algorithmic evaluation and double-blind human comparison tests
- **Results Analytics**: Comparative performance analysis showing how different personas excel at different tasks

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Scientific rigor, research-grade precision, flexibility and control
- **Design Personality**: Laboratory interface meets creative workspace - clinical but approachable
- **Visual Metaphors**: Research lab equipment, comparative analysis, flexible tooling
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean interface that accommodates complex workflows without overwhelming

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with strategic accent colors
- **Primary Color**: Deep purple (#5B21B6) - communicates sophistication, research, AI/tech
- **Secondary Colors**: Slate gray (#334155) for supporting elements and secondary actions
- **Accent Color**: Bright amber (#F59E0B) for active states, highlights, and important actions
- **Color Psychology**: Purple suggests innovation and research depth, amber creates urgency and focus
- **Color Accessibility**: All combinations exceed WCAG AA standards with 4.5:1+ contrast ratios
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (near-white #FEFEFE): Dark slate text (#0F172A)
  - Card (white): Dark slate text (#0F172A)
  - Primary (deep purple): White text
  - Secondary (slate): White text
  - Accent (amber): Dark slate text (#0F172A)
  - Muted (light gray): Medium slate text (#64748B)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for interface text, JetBrains Mono for code/markdown content
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear scale (28px/20px/16px/14px/12px) with mathematical relationships
- **Font Personality**: Inter provides clarity and professionalism for complex interfaces
- **Readability Focus**: 1.6 line height for body text, generous paragraph spacing
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent weight usage (400/500/600/700) across all components
- **Which fonts**: Inter (UI), JetBrains Mono (code/markdown)
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts tested across all sizes and maintain clarity

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Tab navigation with clear workflow progression and visual emphasis on active tasks
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing creates hierarchy and prevents cognitive overload
- **Grid System**: CSS Grid for main layouts, Flexbox for component internal structure
- **Responsive Approach**: Desktop-first with mobile adaptations for complex workflows
- **Content Density**: Moderate - sufficient information visible without overwhelming interface

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Transitions guide workflow progression and show state changes clearly
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Evaluation progress and results comparison get primary animation focus
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Subtle, professional animations that enhance rather than distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for personas/scenarios, Tables for results, Tabs for workflow, Code editors for markdown
- **Component Customization**: Subtle shadows, consistent 8px border radius, branded color integration
- **Component States**: Clear interactive feedback with hover/focus/active states
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for their technical clarity and extensive library
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary (purple), secondary (slate), accent (amber), destructive (red)
- **Spacing System**: 8px base grid with 16px/24px/32px/48px increments
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Responsive stacking, touch-friendly sizing, simplified navigation

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component library with clear design tokens and consistent patterns
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color system, typography scale, spacing rhythm, interaction patterns
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card sizes, aligned grids, predictable component behavior
- **Brand Alignment**: Research-grade precision with approachable interaction design

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance minimum with AAA targets for critical text and interface elements
